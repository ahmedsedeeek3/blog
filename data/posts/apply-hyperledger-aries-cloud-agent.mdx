[GitHub - hyperledger/aries-cloudagent-python: Hyperledger Aries Cloud Agent Python (ACA-Py) is a foundation for building decentralized identity applications and services running in non-mobile environments.](https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-cloudagent-python)

**Build an SSI service using any language that supports HTTP requests**

**Aries Cloud Agent, developed as part of the Hyperledger Aries project, provides the ability for users, businesses, and institutions to manage, store, and securely share identity information. The ACA operates by connecting to decentralized identity (DID) systems and supports message exchange, credential issuance, and verification between different entities.**

### Key Features

- **DID Creation and Management**: ACA supports users in creating and managing identities within a decentralized identity (DID) system. This enables users to prove and manage their identity online.
- **Credential Issuance and Verification**: ACA supports the process of credential issuance and verification between issuers and verifiers. Users can receive credentials and, when necessary, have these credentials verified.
- **Message Exchange**: ACA supports message exchange between different entities. This allows users to securely share and verify identity information.
- **Wallet Management**: ACA provides a wallet function for storing user identity information, credentials, and private keys. This enables users to securely manage and store their identity information.
- **Distributed Ledger Connection**: ACA connects to distributed ledgers like Hyperledger Indy. This allows users to utilize identity information stored on the ledger.
- **Protocol Implementation**: ACA implements the Aries protocol, offering a standardized way for different entities to interact. This ensures compatibility between various decentralized identity systems.

### Running the Demo

1. **Git Clone**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-cloudagent-python.git
