# Bitcoin

**_Bitcoin is a representative public blockchain system announced by Satoshi Nakamoto in 2009._**

---

## Characteristics of Bitcoin

- **Uses ECDSA**, an elliptic curve digital signature algorithm.

- **Has a network of over 9000 Full Nodes.**

- **New blocks are mined approximately every 10 minutes.**

  â¤· _By adjusting the PoW difficulty, the mining speed is controlled, reducing **stale blocks** and preventing the **51% Attack**._

- **The total currency issuance is limited to 21 million.**

  â¤· _Presumably to prevent inflation, after which miners will only receive **Tx fees** as rewards._

- **The average block size is 1.29MB.**

  â¤· _Each block includes approximately 2000 transactions._

### Key

**Uses private and public keys based on the Secp256k1 elliptic curve.**

- **Elliptic Curve**: $Y^2 = (X^3 + 7)â€…modâ€…p$

- **Private Key ($k$)**: A random number between $1$ and $2^{256}$

- **Public Key ($K$)**: $k * G$

  â¤· $G$: A fixed point on the elliptic curve

  â¤· $*$: Multiplication on the elliptic curve

### Address

**The public key mentioned above is 520 bits (65 bytes), which is too large to fit into a block, so we use cryptographic hashes to generate addresses.**

> _The structure of the public key $K$ consists of an 8-bit prefix, a 256-bit x-coordinate, and a 256-bit y-coordinate, totaling **520 bits**._

- **Base-58**

  â¤· _A method that encodes using 58 characters, excluding the confusing characters `0`, `O`, `I`, and `l`._

- **Prefix**

  â¤· _The 8-bit version of the address, which can be referenced from [this list](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/List_of_address_prefixes)._

- **Checksum**

  â¤· _A hashed code for error checking, added to the payload._

### BSL

**Bitcoin Script Language (BSL) is a stack-based, non-Turing-complete language with no looping capability. It evaluates inputs to store either TRUE or FALSE.**

> ðŸ“Œ **_Detailed information about BSL can be found on [Wikipedia](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Script)._**

## Transaction

**In Bitcoin, a transaction represents the flow of currency.**
